- **Reader Promise**: Finish with clear understanding and actionable next steps
- **Content Goal**: Explain complex topics, provide credible analysis, and enable informed decisions

## CRITICAL: Pre-Write Research & Fact-Checking Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Before writing any blog post, AI must perform comprehensive research to prevent outdated assumptions and inaccurate information.

### Universal Research Checklist (Non-Negotiable)
- [ ] **Current Information Verification**: Search for 2024/2025 data for all claims, pricing, statistics
- [ ] **Best Practices Validation**: Verify current industry standards and implementation patterns
- [ ] **Policy & Integration Research**: Confirm current policies, limitations, compatibility
- [ ] **Technology Limitations**: Check for current constraints, quotas, known issues
- [ ] **Real-world Usage Patterns**: Research typical use cases and adoption patterns
- [ ] **Cite All Claims**: Every fact, figure, and technical claim MUST have a recent source

### Fact-Checking Protocol
1. **Web Search Required**: Use WebSearch tool to verify all claims and data
2. **Cross-Reference**: Check multiple sources for consistency
3. **Date Sensitivity**: Prioritize sources from 2024-2025; flag if using older data
