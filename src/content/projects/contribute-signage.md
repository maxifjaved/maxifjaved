# Contribute Signage - Digital Signage Management Platform

## Overview

Developed a comprehensive web-based digital signage management system that enables users to create, distribute, and manage digital content across multiple displays through a cloud-based platform. The solution combines a PHP CodeIgniter web control panel with cross-platform playback applications built using Electron (desktop), Ionic (Android), and React (Chrome extension). Built entirely solo using a hybrid tech stack, the platform serves primarily the education market and corporate environments, offering an intuitive Fabric.js-powered drag-and-drop interface that eliminates the need for graphic design expertise.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

- **Architected and implemented** a complete digital signage ecosystem including web control panel and multi-platform playback applications
- **Built WYSIWYG drag-and-drop editor** enabling non-technical users to create professional digital signage layouts through browser interface
- **Developed multi-platform playback applications** using Electron for Windows/Mac/Linux desktop apps and Ionic for Android, plus Chrome extension with React
- **Integrated comprehensive media gallery** with over 2 million searchable images accessible within the platform
- **Implemented real-time device management system** with GPS location tracking, status monitoring, and remote control capabilities
- **Created advanced scheduling engine** allowing time-based content deployment across multiple devices and channels
- **Built device grouping and organization system** enabling channel-based content distribution (reception areas, classrooms, etc.)
- **Developed user access control system** with granular permissions and unlimited user account support
- **Implemented emergency messaging system** for crisis communication across all connected displays simultaneously
- **Created flexible content support** for multiple file formats including images, videos, widgets (weather, Twitter feeds, clocks)
- **Built per-school licensing model** with unlimited screen support and no monthly subscription requirements
- **Developed touch-enabled layouts** specifically for interactive displays and kiosks
- **Implemented cloud storage integration** for seamless content management and distribution

## Technical Implementation

The platform leverages a hybrid architecture with PHP CodeIgniter as the main web application backend, complemented by Node.js utilities for specific functions. The web control panel utilizes Fabric.js for canvas-based layout editing and React components for interactive UI elements. MySQL database handles all persistent data storage while Digital Ocean Spaces manages media file storage and delivery.

Real-time communication between the web panel and playback devices is achieved through long polling, ensuring instant updates without WebSocket complexity. The multi-platform playback ecosystem consists of Electron-based desktop applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux, an Ionic-based Android application, and a React-powered Chrome extension, all communicating with the central PHP/MySQL backend.

The WYSIWYG editor leverages Fabric.js canvas library for intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, generating layout data that's interpreted by each platform-specific playback application. Device management utilizes unique identification with real-time status reporting through long polling connections. The entire system is hosted on Digital Ocean infrastructure with optimized content delivery through Digital Ocean Spaces CDN.

Hardware compatibility ranges from Android players (recommended RK3399 chip minimum) to Windows PCs (Intel Atom x5 Z8350 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage) and macOS devices, with specific optimizations for touch-enabled displays and POE-powered screens.

## Impact/Results

- **Democratized digital signage creation** by eliminating graphic design skill requirements through intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Enabled scalable deployment** with per-school licensing allowing unlimited screens without per-device costs
