# TIPX - Custom Threat Intelligence Platform

- **Duration**: [Please provide start and end dates]
- **Role**: Full-Stack Developer (Solo)
- **Technologies**: MISP (Open Source), OpenCTI (Open Source), Custom APIs, World Globe Visualization, White-label UI/UX
- **Team Size**: Solo Developer (except design provided via Figma)
- **Platform Type**: Internal Enterprise Threat Intelligence System
- **Client**: Confidential Enterprise Organization

## Overview

Developed a comprehensive white-labeled threat intelligence platform called "TIPX" by integrating and extending two major open source cybersecurity platforms: MISP and OpenCTI. Built entirely solo, this solution provides a unified threat intelligence management system with custom features, complete UI/UX redesign, and specialized APIs for enterprise integration. The platform combines MISP's robust indicator sharing capabilities with OpenCTI's modern threat intelligence management, enhanced with custom visualization tools and enterprise-specific workflows for internal cybersecurity operations.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

- **Architected and implemented** complete integration between MISP and OpenCTI platforms creating unified threat intelligence ecosystem
- **Built custom API layer** enabling seamless communication with client's internal systems and existing security infrastructure
- **Developed innovative World Globe visualization** providing real-time geographical threat intelligence statistics and data navigation
- **Implemented complete white-label solution** with custom branding, UI/UX design, and enterprise-specific workflows
- **Created unified threat intelligence dashboard** combining MISP events and OpenCTI knowledge graphs in single interface
- **Built custom data synchronization engine** ensuring real-time consistency between MISP indicators and OpenCTI threat intelligence
- **Developed enhanced visualization tools** providing at-a-glance threat statistics and interactive data exploration capabilities
- **Implemented enterprise-grade authentication** and access controls tailored to client's organizational structure
- **Created custom threat intelligence workflows** optimized for client's specific cybersecurity operations and processes
- **Built advanced filtering and search capabilities** across integrated MISP and OpenCTI datasets
- **Developed real-time threat intelligence feeds** with automated indicator correlation and relationship mapping
- **Implemented custom reporting engine** generating executive-level threat intelligence summaries and technical analysis reports

## Technical Implementation

The platform leverages the robust foundations of both MISP and OpenCTI while extending their capabilities through custom development. The integration layer seamlessly connects MISP's threat sharing infrastructure with OpenCTI's GraphQL-based knowledge management, creating a unified threat intelligence ecosystem.

The custom API layer provides RESTful endpoints specifically designed for the client's internal systems, enabling automated threat intelligence ingestion, indicator sharing, and real-time security alert integration. This API architecture ensures seamless communication between TIPX and existing security tools, SIEM systems, and threat detection platforms.

The World Globe visualization represents a key innovation, providing interactive geographical mapping of threat intelligence data sourced from both MISP events and OpenCTI entities. This feature enables security analysts to quickly identify global threat patterns, regional attack trends, and geographical correlation of indicators, with drill-down capabilities to detailed threat intelligence records.

The white-label implementation involved complete UI/UX redesign based on provided Figma specifications, replacing default MISP and OpenCTI interfaces with custom-branded, enterprise-optimized workflows. The new interface provides role-based dashboards, customized navigation, and organization-specific threat intelligence presentation formats.

Data synchronization between MISP and OpenCTI maintains real-time consistency through custom connectors that automatically correlate indicators, update threat intelligence attributes, and ensure data integrity across both platforms while preserving each system's native capabilities.
