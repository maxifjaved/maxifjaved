# TouchIT Air - iOS Screen Mirroring Receiver for Interactive Displays

- **Duration**: [Please provide start and end dates]
- **Role**: Full-Stack Developer (Solo)
- **Technologies**: Java (Android), AirplayServer (Open Source), AirPlay Protocol Implementation
- **Team Size**: Solo Developer (except design)
- **Company**: TouchIT Technologies

## Overview

Developed a native Android application that enables seamless iOS screen mirroring to TouchIT Interactive LED displays without requiring additional hardware. Built entirely solo using Java for Android, this solution transforms TouchIT LEDs into AirPlay-compatible receivers, allowing teachers and presenters to wirelessly mirror content from iPhones, iPads, and Macs directly to classroom and boardroom displays. The application addresses the critical need for reliable, interruption-free screen sharing in educational and corporate environments.

- **Implemented performance optimization** ensuring low latency screen mirroring suitable for interactive teaching
- **Created device compatibility layer** supporting various iOS device types and screen resolutions

## Technical Implementation

The application leverages native Android development using Java, building upon the open source AirplayServer project as the foundation for AirPlay protocol implementation. The solution integrates and extends this library to create a complete AirPlay receiver that seamlessly integrates with Apple's screen mirroring ecosystem, handling device discovery through Bonjour/mDNS, connection establishment, and real-time screen streaming.

The Android application runs as a background service on TouchIT LED displays, utilizing the AirplayServer library to continuously advertise its availability as an AirPlay receiver on the local network. Custom modifications were implemented to optimize the library for TouchIT's specific hardware requirements and educational use cases.

The screen mirroring implementation extends the base AirplayServer functionality to handle various iOS device resolutions and orientations, with custom scaling and optimization logic for large interactive display formats. Additional layers were built on top of the open source foundation to manage TouchIT-specific features, video decoding optimization, and display rendering while maintaining low latency essential for interactive presentations.

Security enhancements were added beyond the base library capabilities to prevent unauthorized device connections and implement session management ensuring only the intended presenter maintains control. Custom network handling was implemented to manage topology changes and reconnection logic for seamless user experience across varying WiFi conditions typical in educational institutions.
