## Technical Implementation

The platform addresses the fundamental challenge of TouchIT LED displays lacking Google Play Services by providing an alternative app distribution method specifically tailored for educational and corporate interactive displays. The solution leverages a React frontend with Node.js backend, deployed on Digital Ocean infrastructure with Digital Ocean Spaces handling APK file storage and distribution.

The web platform built with React enables administrators and users to browse, search, and manage applications through intuitive category-based navigation. The native Android applications (v1 in Java, v2 migrated to React Native) run directly on TouchIT LED displays, providing local access to the curated app ecosystem through communication with the Node.js API endpoints.

The platform includes automated content acquisition processes for expanding the app catalog when needed, working within appropriate usage guidelines. The system implements secure APK storage on Digital Ocean Spaces with CDN distribution, ensuring fast downloads and integrity verification of all applications.

App curation involves rigorous testing for compatibility with TouchIT hardware specifications including Android 8.0 requirements and interactive display functionality. The platform maintains a continuous pipeline for app additions, with automated acquisition, testing, and manual review processes to ensure educational appropriateness and technical compatibility across the entire TouchIT LED ecosystem.
