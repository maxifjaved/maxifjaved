# Contribute Cloud - Educational Collaboration Platform

## Overview

Developed a comprehensive cloud-based educational collaboration platform that revolutionizes classroom interaction by enabling real-time content sharing, screen casting, and interactive learning across any device with a browser. The platform serves K-12 education, higher education, and corporate training sectors as an integral component of TouchIT Technologies' LED display ecosystem, deployed across numerous schools worldwide. Built entirely solo using Node.js, React, MongoDB, and OpenVidu WebRTC, the platform provides a complete solution for modern digital classrooms without requiring any software installation.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

- **Architected and implemented** the entire full-stack application from scratch, handling all technical aspects from backend API development to frontend user interface
- **Built real-time collaboration features** including multi-user screen casting, simultaneous multi-cast display (unlimited screens with scrollable view), and live group chat functionality using WebRTC and WebSocket technologies
- **Developed cloud-based file management system** supporting multiple formats (PDFs, images, videos, YouTube content) with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Integrated major cloud storage providers** including Google Drive, Google Classroom, Dropbox, and OneDrive for seamless content access
- **Built comprehensive image library** with over 1.5 million searchable images accessible within the platform's Content Gallery
- **Implemented 40+ interactive learning games** with multi-zone collaborative gamification where multiple students can interact simultaneously on the same screen
- **Created voting and polling system** with live graphical results display, allowing real-time student feedback without additional hardware
- **Built live lesson recording capabilities** with teacher video broadcasting and both self-paced and teacher-led modes
- **Engineered cross-platform compatibility** ensuring seamless operation across Chromebooks, PCs, MACs, and tablets with specific Chromebook optimization
- **Designed scalable architecture** to support unlimited concurrent participants per session with low latency
- **Implemented secure file transfer system** for content distribution between teachers and students

- **Developed unlimited cloud storage system** with fair use policy for all user content within the platform
- **Implemented workbook export functionality** allowing complete lesson download to PDF format
- **Created multi-language support** enabling global accessibility for diverse educational environments
- **Built annotation and drawing tools** with table tool functionality for interactive lesson creation

## Technical Implementation

The platform leverages a sophisticated tech stack combining Node.js backend with React frontend, orchestrated through a microservices architecture on Digital Ocean infrastructure. Real-time communication is powered by OpenVidu's WebRTC implementation, enabling ultra-low latency video conferencing and screen sharing with support for 50+ concurrent users per room. Socket.io handles bidirectional real-time events for instant messaging, collaborative drawing, and live updates across all connected devices.

The collaborative whiteboard features are built using Fabric.js canvas library, enabling smooth multi-user drawing experiences with real-time synchronization. MongoDB provides flexible document storage for user sessions, lesson content, and collaborative data, while AWS S3 handles secure file uploads and content delivery with optimized CDN distribution. The architecture implements horizontal scaling through Digital Ocean's load balancers to support multiple schools simultaneously accessing the platform as part of TouchIT Technologies' display suite.
