The V2 frontend architecture leverages React framework with Laravel backend and MySQL database to deliver a responsive, high-performance analytics platform optimized for marketing professionals. The interface provides intuitive access to complex AI insights through carefully designed data visualization components that transform raw analytics data into actionable business intelligence.

The AI insights implementation integrates machine learning capabilities to automatically analyze marketing data patterns, identifying significant events, traffic anomalies, and campaign performance correlations. The system processes data from Google Analytics 4, Google Ads, and other connected platforms to generate contextual annotations that explain marketing performance fluctuations.

The integration system handles real-time data synchronization, webhook management, and secure API communication with external platforms including Mailchimp, GitHub, Bitbucket, and project management tools.

The Chrome extension extends platform capabilities directly into users' browsers, providing real-time analytics overlay and automated annotation functionality. The extension utilizes Chrome APIs for secure data access while maintaining synchronization with the main platform through authenticated API calls.

Cross-platform architecture deployed on Google Cloud Platform ensures seamless data flow between web application, Chrome extension, and integrated third-party services, with real-time updates and consistent user experience across all touchpoints. GCP infrastructure provides scalable hosting, automated deployment pipelines, and reliable performance for the analytics platform.
